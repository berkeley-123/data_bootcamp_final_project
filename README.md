Project discription: 
This project will study how varying levels of state funding for educational programs (including: "support for disadvantaged childern", "impact aid", "low-income achievement program", "English language acquisition", and "preschool grants") will impact the average SAT scores by state. To do so I will compare the percent increase in SAT scores between 2017 and 2018 and the percent increase in funding per school between 2017 and 2018 (both by state). Ultimatly, I will create two heat maps, and other supporting graphs.
